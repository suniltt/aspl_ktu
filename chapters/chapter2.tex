\section{Simulating Coin Toss}
 The probability of getting a Heads or a Tails on a coin toss is both 0.5.  We can use
R to simulate an experiment of flipping a coin a number of times and compare our results with
the theoretical probability.  

0 = Tails and 1 = Heads


\begin{lstlisting}[language=R]

sample(0:1,15,rep=T)  #flip 15 times
 
# read the manual for sample function and try to under stand the options.
help(sample) 
\end{lstlisting}

Let us write a small function so that we can easily repeat coin toss experiment and calculate probability of getting 1.
 \begin{lstlisting}[language=R]
 flip= function(n) sample(0:1,n,rep=T) # look at the function definition and the argument passing.
 exp1<-flip (100) 	# let us flip 100 times
 prob= sum(exp1==1)/100
 
 exp2= flip(10000);   # a  semi colon suppresses long outputs
 prob= sum(exp2==1)/10000
 
 \end{lstlisting}
 
 Rolling a dice with six faces 20 times can be simulated in R using 
 sample(1:6,20,rep=T).  Write a function to simulate roll of a dice and roll it 10000 time. Compute the probability of getting 4 any number less than 4.
