  \section{Introduction}
   We will try to under stand random sampling and the importance of central limit theorem.
   
   \subsection{Random samples}
   \subsection{Central limit theorem}
   The  central limit theorem is probably the most important theorem in statistics. let $x_1,x_2\cdots x_n$ be random samples from any distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma ^2$ , central limit theorem states that  for large sample size n the sampling distribution of sample mean $\hat{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum{i=1}^{n} X_i$ is approximately normal with mean $\sigma$ and variance $\sigma^2 / n$
